This is my implementation of the Lox Language, and a Bytecode Virtual Machine Interpreter and Compiler. 

This design came from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), by Robert Nystrom. 

This was also the first project I completed entirely with Vim, instead of VS Code. That's just for fun, mostly, and learning Vim Motions. Learning Vim Motions and Vim as a whole has been incredibly gratifying, and I am pretty happy with the state of my NeoVim configuration at the end of this. Getting the hang of it was a real grog, and probably resulted in this project taking twice as long as it otherwise would, but I think it was worth learning. :)
